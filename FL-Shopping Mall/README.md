# FederatedLearning

A basic implementation of the Federated Averaging Algorithm, written in Python with support for TensorFlow and Keras (Experiments are produced on ENERNOC 2012 Commercial Energy Consumption Data). 

## Description
Data, presenting the annual energy consumption of 9 Shppoing centers, was utilzed: 8 shopping centers hostory was used for the training process and the 9_th one was used as a test subject to evalute the global model. 

### Example of the data used:

## Results:
A Global model's RMSE eq ~0.05 for the non-participant client (9th shopping center) for 10 rounds of FL training and 5 epochs of local training.
